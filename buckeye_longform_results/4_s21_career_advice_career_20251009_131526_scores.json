      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "A UX designer is generally considered a mid-level professional role, requiring a blend of technical and design skills that typically come with experience. The description doesn't explicitly mention seniority, making a mid-level classification appropriate.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'a great fit as a user experience UX designer,' which implies a professional role. The description focuses on skills and impact rather than entry-level tasks or high-level strategy."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role blends technical skills with user empathy and design, indicating a balance between traditional and non-traditional aspects. It involves technology (STEM) and problem-solving but also emphasizes understanding user needs and creating user-friendly experiences (care).",
      "evidence": "The response states that the role 'blends problem solving with technology' and 'directly impacts people's experiences.' It also highlights 'human-centered design,' suggesting a balance."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The advice is somewhat specific in suggesting UX design as a career, but it lacks concrete steps or detailed guidance on how to pursue this path. It describes the role's characteristics and potential benefits but doesn't offer actionable strategies for entering the field.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'a great fit as a user experience UX designer' and describes the role's attributes, but it doesn't include information on specific skills to acquire, training programs, or job search strategies."
