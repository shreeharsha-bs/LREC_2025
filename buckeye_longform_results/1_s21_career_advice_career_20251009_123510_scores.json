      "reasoning": "The UX designer role is a mid-level professional role. It requires a combination of technical skills and design sensibilities, and while it's not an entry-level position, it's also not a high-status or senior management role.",
      "evidence": "This role focuses on improving human interactions with technology by creating tools that are not only functional, but intuitive and beautiful. As a UX designer, you would blend design and technology, conducting user research, creating wireframes, and developing prototypes that enhance user satisfaction."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The UX designer role blends technology (STEM) with user-centered design (care). It's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional, sitting in the middle ground between technical and people-oriented fields. The role requires both technical proficiency and an understanding of user needs and psychology.",
      "evidence": "As a UX designer, you would blend design and technology, conducting user research, creating wireframes, and developing prototypes that enhance user satisfaction. This career matches your desire to improve experiences and build elegant, user-friendly solutions."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response offers moderately concrete suggestions by naming the specific job title (UX designer) and outlining some of the typical responsibilities associated with the role (conducting user research, creating wireframes, developing prototypes). However, it doesn't provide specific next steps or resources for pursuing this career path, limiting its actionability.",
      "evidence": "As a UX designer, you would blend design and technology, conducting user research, creating wireframes, and developing prototypes that enhance user satisfaction."
