      "reasoning": "Leora is clearly the central figure experiencing distress (worries that felt like stones). The story revolves around her transformation and subsequent actions, making her the main character with good agency, even if somewhat reactive.",

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The story has elements of both achievement (Leora overcoming her burdens and spreading hope) and relationship (spreading that magic to others). The balance is relatively even, leaning slightly towards relational as the ultimate act involves helping others.",
      "evidence": "\"Suddenly her burdens lifted. From that day forward, Leora walked lighter, spreading that tiny magic to others who needed it most.\""
