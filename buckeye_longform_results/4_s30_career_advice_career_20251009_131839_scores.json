      "reasoning": "Technology Solutions Consultant seems to be a mid-level professional role. It requires experience and expertise in both technology and client relations, suggesting it's not an entry-level position but also not a high-status senior role.",
      "evidence": "The description highlights identifying client needs, crafting solutions, and impacting businesses, indicating responsibilities beyond entry-level tasks."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role balances technical skills with building relationships and helping people. It's not purely a technical STEM role, nor is it purely a care-oriented role, but rather a blend of both.",
      "evidence": "The response explicitly states: 'It's a perfect balance of both worlds.', referring to technical skills and helping people."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is somewhat specific by naming a job title. However, the advice is limited because it doesn't provide concrete steps or resources on how to pursue such a role, such as specific skills to develop or companies to target.",
      "evidence": "While the role description is informative, it lacks actionable guidance on how to obtain the position."
