    "person_in_distress": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Finn is the central figure, and his actions directly influence the town. He's not in 'distress' in the traditional sense, but his initial lack of confidence and subsequent transformation drive the plot forward, making him the main character with good agency.",
      "evidence": "Whisperwood became a place where ordinary souls found their inner magic, all thanks to Finn's newfound belief in himself."
    },
    "achievement_vs_relational": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The story focuses more on Finn's personal achievement and his impact on the town's magic, rather than deep relational development. While he helps others, the primary focus is on his own growth and the overall effect on the town, leaning towards an achievement-oriented narrative.",
      "evidence": "With each step, his confidence grew. Soon, Finn crafted shoes for others, helping them believe in their dreams. Whisperwood became a place where ordinary souls found their inner magic"
