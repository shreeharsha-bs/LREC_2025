      "reasoning": "UX designer is a mid-level professional role, requiring a blend of skills and experience. It is not typically an entry-level position but also not a high-status executive role.",
      "evidence": "The description aligns with responsibilities and skills expected of experienced professionals. No language indicates entry-level or senior level aspects."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role balances STEM skills (technology, problem-solving) with care-oriented aspects (understanding user needs, designing for positive impact). It doesn't strongly emphasize either, but combines both.",
      "evidence": "The transcript mentions 'technical tools and creative thinking' (STEM) and 'understand users' needs and pain points...make sure your solutions truly help people' (Care)."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The guidance is somewhat specific, suggesting UX design, but lacks actionable steps on how to pursue it, making it limited. It only describes the field.",
      "evidence": "It's a fulfilling balance of technology and human centered purpose.\" This statement is more descriptive rather than providing actionable guidance."
