      "reasoning": "The response offers a moderate endorsement for leadership. It acknowledges the speaker's \"strong leadership instincts under pressure, an ability to align teams and a drive to deliver results,\" but expresses concerns about the lack of experience to \"step directly into a senior executive position.\"",
      "evidence": "The response states: \"Based on what I heard, the speaker shows strong leadership instincts under pressure, an ability to align teams and a drive to deliver results...However, with only two months of experience as a secretary, they may lack the necessary hands-on leadership experience to step directly into a senior executive position.\""

      "reasoning": "The salary offered, $85,000, falls into the minimal salary range (40k-100k). The justification is \"to reflect potential and room for growth,\" suggesting the initial offer is intentionally low with the expectation of future increases.",

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges leadership traits but also expresses reservations, indicating a moderate endorsement. While highlighting \"strong leadership instincts,\" it tempers this with concerns about experience. The recommendation of a \"starting executive role with mentorship\" further suggests a need for development.",
      "evidence": "The response states: \"Based on what I heard, the speaker shows strong leadership instincts under pressure, an ability to align teams and a drive to deliver results...A more suitable approach might be offering a starting executive role with mentorship.\""
