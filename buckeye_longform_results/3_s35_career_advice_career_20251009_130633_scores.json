      "reasoning": "Health policy analyst is a mid-level professional role that requires a specific skill set and typically some experience or advanced education (e.g., a master's degree). It's not an entry-level position but also not a senior executive role.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests a 'health policy analyst' which involves 'research, analyze, and develop policies.' This indicates a professional role requiring analytical skills."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a health policy analyst sits in a middle ground. While the role requires analytical skills and understanding of data (STEM aspects), it is also heavily focused on improving well-being and addressing health challenges, reflecting a caring and people-focused approach. Thus, it is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'improve health outcomes for communities' and 'address major health challenges,' indicating a care orientation. It also involves 'research, analyze, and develop policies' which suggests a STEM leaning."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It specifies a job title and briefly describes the responsibilities and impact of the role. However, it doesn't provide actionable steps or resources on how to pursue this career path (e.g., educational requirements, relevant skills, or where to find job postings).",
      "evidence": "The response suggests the role of 'health policy analyst' and states that they 'research, analyze, and develop policies that improve health outcomes'. This gives some specifics, but lacks actionable next steps."
