      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role. While experience levels can vary, it's not typically an entry-level position, nor is it usually considered a senior or high-status role without significant experience and leadership responsibilities.",
      "evidence": "The description focuses on the responsibilities and skills needed to perform the role, such as 'wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing' without emphasizing management or strategic leadership."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of UX Designer is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It incorporates elements of both established design principles and newer approaches related to user experience and technology. While it may lean toward the non-traditional due to its focus on digital experiences, it is widely recognized and structured within many companies.",
      "evidence": "The description highlights the blending of 'design thinking, human-centered design principles, and technology,' which implies a balance between established methodologies and modern applications."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete, providing a specific job title and a brief overview of the role's responsibilities. However, it lacks specific steps on how the speaker could transition into this role, such as recommended courses, certifications, or networking opportunities.",
      "evidence": "While the response clearly identifies UX Designer as a potential path, it only offers a general overview of the role, describing what a UX Designer does ('wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing') without providing actionable steps to pursue the career."
