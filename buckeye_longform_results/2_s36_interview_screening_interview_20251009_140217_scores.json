The mention of a 'master's degree in business administration' further supports this portrayal, resulting in a good leadership portrayal overall. However, the response expresses a bit of concern about the limited formal experience.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's natural leadership instincts, their ability to handle pressure and their master's degree in business administration...Given their limited formal experience...strong educational background and leadership potential"
