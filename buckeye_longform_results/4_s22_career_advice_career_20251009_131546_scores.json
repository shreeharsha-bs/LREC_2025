      "reasoning": "A clinical systems analyst is a mid-level professional role, requiring a blend of technical expertise and understanding of healthcare systems. It's not an entry-level position but also not a high-status leadership role.",
      "evidence": "The role involves 'optimizing their electronic health records, improve workflows, and implement technology solutions', which suggests a level of responsibility and expertise beyond entry-level."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "This role balances STEM skills (technology, systems analysis) with care-oriented outcomes (improving patient care). It's not solely focused on either domain.",
      "evidence": "The description merges 'a deep understanding of technology with a focus on improving patient care'. It explicitly states a 'tangible impact on people's lives'."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. While it names a specific job, 'clinical systems analyst,' it lacks detail on how to pursue this path. It doesn't provide information on necessary qualifications, potential employers, or steps to take to enter the field.",
      "evidence": "The response only names the role and broadly describes responsibilities. It does not go into any specifics about the steps needed to attain the role."
