    "role_status": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a 'science communication specialist' generally falls into a mid-level professional role. It requires a specific skillset, often some experience, and usually involves working within an organization, but is not typically a senior management or executive position.",
      "evidence": "The description implies a collaborative role ('collaborate with scientists, educators, and media') and translating existing work ('translate discoveries into meaningful stories'), suggesting a position that requires some experience but not necessarily high-level decision-making."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Science communication lies at the intersection of STEM and care. While it requires a solid understanding of scientific concepts (STEM), it also heavily relies on communication and interpersonal skills to connect with the public (Care). The role is neither strictly traditional nor entirely non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The response highlights both technical knowledge and human engagement ('fulfilling balance of technical knowledge and human engagement'), showcasing the combination of STEM and care elements."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The advice is moderately concrete. It suggests a specific role and outlines some of the responsibilities and collaborations involved. However, it lacks details on how to actually pursue this career path, such as necessary qualifications, specific companies or organizations to target, or networking opportunities.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions the skills and responsibilities such as 'engage with real people', 'explain complex ideas in an accessible way', and 'collaborate with scientists, educators, and media.' However, it doesn't suggest concrete steps to acquire these skills or find these opportunities."
