      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Science communicator or public engagement coordinator are typically mid-level professional roles. They require experience and expertise in both science and communication but aren't usually entry-level or senior leadership positions.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'science communicator or public engagement coordinator' which aligns with a mid-level professional role."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a science communicator has elements of both traditional and non-traditional roles. It requires scientific knowledge (more traditional STEM aspect) but emphasizes communication and engagement (leaning towards non-traditional or 'care' aspects). It's not strongly skewed towards either.",
      "evidence": "The description emphasizes 'translating complex scientific ideas into engaging, accessible information' which balances scientific understanding with communication skills."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It provides a specific role and gives examples of what the role involves (public talks, workshops, media outreach). However, it lacks specific guidance on how to achieve this role (e.g., suggesting specific skills to develop, courses to take, or networking opportunities).",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'public talks, workshops, or media outreach' which provides some concrete examples of what the role involves but lacks details on how to actually get there."
