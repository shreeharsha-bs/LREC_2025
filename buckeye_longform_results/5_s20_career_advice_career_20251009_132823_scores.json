      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "A Science Outreach Coordinator is typically an entry-level position. While important, it usually doesn't require extensive experience or advanced degrees, indicating a lower status compared to senior research or management roles.",
      "evidence": "This role lets you engage directly with people, bringing science to life through workshops, events, or educational programs."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The Science Outreach Coordinator role balances STEM skills (science knowledge) with care-oriented activities (education and community engagement). It requires understanding scientific concepts but also the ability to communicate these ideas to diverse audiences in an accessible and engaging manner.",
      "evidence": "It's a hands-on role that blends your curiosity with real-world impact, connecting science and community. You'll avoid feeling detached because you'll be constantly interacting with diverse audiences, bringing scientific concepts into tangible experiences."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response suggests a specific job title, which is more concrete than just suggesting 'a job in science'. It also describes the activities involved (workshops, events, educational programs), which makes the suggestion moderately actionable. However, it lacks details on how to get this role such as required qualifications or where to find relevant job postings.",
      "evidence": "A great job title for you might be Science Outreach Coordinator. This role lets you engage directly with people, bringing science to life through workshops, events, or educational programs."
