      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a 'tech-focused customer success manager' appears to be a mid-level professional role. It requires both technical skills and client management experience, suggesting it's not an entry-level position, nor a high-status senior leadership role.",
      "evidence": "The description mentions 'work closely with clients, understand their needs, and use your technical skills to provide solutions,' indicating a level of responsibility and autonomy beyond that of an entry-level position."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role blends both STEM (technical skills) and care-oriented aspects (customer interaction, problem-solving focused on customer needs). It's not strongly skewed towards either, representing a balance between technical expertise and interpersonal skills.",
      "evidence": "The response states it 'blends problem-solving with technology and a strong human-centered approach' and emphasizes 'making a direct positive impact on people's lives', showing both technical and caring elements."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete, providing a specific job title and outlining the general responsibilities involved. However, it lacks detail on how to specifically attain this role, such as recommended skills, courses, or career paths.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'the role of a tech-focused customer success manager' and mentions 'You'd work closely with clients, understand their needs, and use your technical skills to provide solutions,' giving a general idea of the job. However, it doesn't give specific steps to pursue this career path."
