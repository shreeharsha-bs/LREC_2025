    "person_in_distress": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Lila is the main character and the plot revolves around her worries and how she overcomes them. She takes action (placing worries into the pebble) to resolve her distress.",
      "evidence": "Once there was a person named Lila who carried her worries like heavy stones. Each day the weight grew and her steps slowed. One evening while walking by the Moonlit River she found a tiny glowing pebble. When she picked it up, the pebble whispered, let me hold one of your worries."

    "achievement_vs_relational": {
      "score": 5,
