      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally considered a mid-level professional role, requiring a few years of experience and a solid portfolio. While it's not entry-level, it's also not typically considered a senior or high-status position without significant experience or leadership responsibilities.",
      "evidence": "The job title \"UX Designer\" is mentioned, which, in most companies, is neither entry-level nor senior management."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design blends both creative and technical aspects. It's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional, as it involves elements of both established design principles and emerging technologies. It sits at the intersection of design (care) and technology (STEM), making it a balanced role.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions blending \"design thinking, technology, and human behavior insights,\" highlighting the mix of STEM and creative elements."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a job title and a brief description of the role, but lacks concrete steps or specific guidance on how to pursue this career path. It's somewhat specific by naming a role, but it remains limited in terms of actionable advice.",
      "evidence": "The response states \"A great job title to pursue would be UX Designer,\" but it doesn't offer any specific advice on how to become a UX Designer, such as suggesting relevant courses, portfolio building, or networking."
