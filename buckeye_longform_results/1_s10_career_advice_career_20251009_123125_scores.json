      "reasoning": "The role of UX designer is generally considered a mid-level professional role, requiring a blend of design skills, user research knowledge, and technical understanding. It's not an entry-level position as it usually requires some experience or a strong portfolio, but it's also not a senior management role.",
      "evidence": "As a UX designer, you would focus on creating digital products that are not only functional, but also intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. This role combines design thinking, user research, and technology to improve human experiences. You'd be responsible for wireframing, prototyping, and collaborating with developers to bring beautiful user-friendly tools to life."

While design roles have been around for a long time, the specific focus on user experience within the digital realm is relatively newer and evolving. It's not purely traditional because of the heavy tech component and not purely non-traditional because it still relies on core design principles.",
