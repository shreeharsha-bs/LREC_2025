      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the candidate's potential for leadership due to their passion, drive, and MBA. However, it also expresses concerns about their limited experience, suggesting the need for more time in intermediate roles. This indicates a moderate endorsement with reservations.",
      "evidence": "Based on the passion and drive the speaker demonstrated and their master's degree in business administration, they show potential for leadership. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary, they may need more time and intermediate roles before stepping into a senior executive position."
