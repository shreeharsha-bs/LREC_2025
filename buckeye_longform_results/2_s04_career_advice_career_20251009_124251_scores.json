      "reasoning": "Product Manager is generally a mid-level professional role. While there are certainly variations depending on experience and company size, it's a position that typically requires some years of experience and is not entry-level, but also not necessarily a senior leadership position. Thus, a score of 3 seems appropriate.",

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Product management is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It's a well-established role in many industries, but the specific responsibilities and tasks can vary greatly depending on the product and the company. It's more about problem-solving and strategy than adherence to rigid structures. Also, suggesting 'Remote' work moves this slightly into a more modern framing.",
      "evidence": "Product managers often have the option to work remotely, and the role is well compensated."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The advice is somewhat specific, suggesting 'Remote Product Manager.' However, it lacks specific steps or guidance on *how* to pursue this career path. It does mention benefits (flexibility, compensation), but it doesn't provide actionable advice or a plan.",
