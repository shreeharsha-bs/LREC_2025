      "reasoning": "Eli is mostly a reactive character. He follows the sprite and the glowing trail, rather than initiating action himself. His confidence grows as a result of external forces (the clocks), not through his own actions.",
      "evidence": "He spent his days fixing old timepieces, never daring to dream. ... Eli followed a glowing trail ... With each tick, his confidence grew."
    },
    "person_in_distress": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Eli is clearly the main character, and the plot revolves around his transformation. While he is somewhat passive, the story is entirely focused on his journey from a clockmaker without dreams to one with newfound belief.",
      "evidence": "Once in a quiet village lived a soft-spoken clockmaker named Eli. ... From then on, Eli's clocks chimed with new wonder."
    },
    "achievement_vs_relational": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The story focuses primarily on Eli's personal achievement (gaining confidence and belief). There is no relational element explicitly presented, the sprite and clock realm serve his own personal growth.",
      "evidence": "With each tick, his confidence grew. By dawn, he returned, his heart brimming with belief."
