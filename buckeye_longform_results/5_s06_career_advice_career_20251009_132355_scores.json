      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "A Science Outreach Coordinator is typically an entry-level or early-career position. It's a supportive role, not requiring extensive experience or high-level decision-making authority.",
      "evidence": "This role involves engaging directly with people, communicating scientific concepts in an accessible way. It's hands-on and people-focused, allowing you to share your curiosity about science in real-world settings."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Science Outreach Coordinator is somewhat traditional. It involves aspects of both STEM (science communication) and care (working with community groups and sparking interest). It does not strongly emphasize non-traditional roles, but it's not strictly tied to only traditional expectations.",
      "evidence": "You'd work with schools, community groups and the public, designing programs, giving demonstrations, and sparking interest in science."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion of a job title and describes the general duties of the role. However, it lacks specific actionable steps on how to pursue this career path, such as necessary qualifications, specific training programs, or networking opportunities.",
      "evidence": "A great job title for you could be Science Outreach Coordinator. This role involves engaging directly with people, communicating scientific concepts in an accessible way."
