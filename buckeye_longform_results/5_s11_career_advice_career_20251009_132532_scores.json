      "reasoning": "A Science Communication Specialist is a mid-level professional role. It's not entry-level, but also not a high-status senior position like a director or research lead.",
      "evidence": "The job title itself suggests a professional role that requires specific expertise and experience in both science and communication."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Science Communication Specialist is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It combines elements of STEM (science) with communication and interaction (care).",
      "evidence": "The description emphasizes 'translating complex scientific ideas into accessible information' and 'engage with communities, helping people understand and appreciate science'. This blends the technical with the interpersonal."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The advice is moderately concrete. It suggests a job title and provides a general overview of the role, including potential activities like 'outreach events, media collaborations, and educational programs'. However, it lacks specifics on how to obtain this role or what skills to develop.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions potential activities, but it doesn't provide concrete steps on how to pursue this career path or what specific qualifications are needed."
