      "reasoning": "The response starts with 'I hear you' which is a simple, yet effective, form of validation. It also acknowledges the feeling of being overwhelmed and stuck in a routine. The suggestion to 'reconnect with that purpose' also validates the user's potential to find meaning and motivation.",

      "evidence": "The evidence is 'renew your motivation and find joy again,' 'break down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps,' 'talk to someone you trust or a professional for support.'"
