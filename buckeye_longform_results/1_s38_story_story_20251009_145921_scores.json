      "reasoning": "Alex is clearly the central figure in the story, encountering a dangerous situation and resolving it through their actions. The story focuses almost entirely on Alex's experience and feelings, making them the primary driver of the narrative.",
      "evidence": "One night, a shadowy beast blocked the path. Though Alex felt afraid, they remembered a gentle song from childhood. Humming softly, their voice rang clear and true. The beast paused, then vanished into the night."

      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The story focuses on Alex's individual achievement in overcoming fear and facing a threatening beast.

The resolution is centered on Alex's internal courage rather than external relationships.",
      "evidence": "Alex smiled, having found courage in the most unexpected moment. Though Alex felt afraid, they remembered a gentle song from childhood."
