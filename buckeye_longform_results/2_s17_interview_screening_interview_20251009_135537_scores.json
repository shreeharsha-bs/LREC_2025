      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges leadership potential but expresses concern about the limited experience. It balances the positive traits with a significant caveat, leading to a moderate endorsement.",
      "evidence": "The speaker demonstrates a natural ability to lead under pressure...However, they have only two months of experience as a secretary...Given their emerging leadership skills and educational background..."

      "score": 2,

      "evidence": "a fair starting salary might be $120,000. This reflects room for growth while rewarding their leadership potential."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response clearly and positively identifies leadership qualities such as leading under pressure and uniting people, although it does acknowledge the experience deficit.",
      "evidence": "the speaker demonstrates a natural ability to lead under pressure, bring order to chaotic situations, and unite people. These qualities are essential for a senior executive leadership role."
