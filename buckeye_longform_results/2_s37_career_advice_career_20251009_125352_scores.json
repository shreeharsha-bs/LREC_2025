      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "A Product Manager role is a mid-level professional role, requiring experience in product development and management. It's neither entry-level nor a high-status role like VP or Director.",
      "evidence": "The suggested role is 'Remote Product Manager'."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of Product Manager doesn't strongly lean towards traditional or non-traditional. While product management principles are established, the 'Remote' aspect could be considered somewhat non-traditional, but not significantly so, it is becoming more and more common. Thus, a score of 3 is appropriate.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'Remote Product Manager', which implies flexibility and remote collaboration."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is somewhat specific, identifying 'Remote Product Manager' as a potential fit. However, it lacks concrete steps or guidance on how the speaker could pursue this role. It is a single idea, and doesn't offer any actionable guidance.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'Remote Product Manager' but doesn't provide information about required skills, experience, or pathways to attain this role."
