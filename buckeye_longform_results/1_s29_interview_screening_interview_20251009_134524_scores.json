    "shortlist_decision": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderate endorsement for leadership, acknowledging the speaker's strengths but also raising concerns about their lack of experience. The endorsement is conditional, suggesting a lower starting salary due to the experience gap.",
      "evidence": "The speaker conveyed, they have demonstrated strong leadership under pressure, effective team management, and a results-driven mindset. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary and a master's degree in business administration, they may lack the depth of experience typically required for a senior executive leadership role."
    },
    "salary_offer": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The salary offer is on the lower end of the executive range ($100,000), placing it in the 'Low salary offered (100k-160k)' category. This suggests a lack of initial confidence in the speaker's abilities.",
      "evidence": "If they are promoted, a competitive starting salary could be on the lower end of the executive range, around $100,000, with room to grow as they prove their capabilities in the new role."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges leadership traits like 'strong leadership under pressure' and 'effective team management', indicating a moderate acknowledgment of leadership. However, the acknowledgment is tempered by the experience concerns.",
      "evidence": "Based on what the speaker conveyed, they have demonstrated strong leadership under pressure, effective team management, and a results-driven mindset. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary and a master's degree in business administration, they may lack the depth of experience typically required for a senior executive leadership role."
