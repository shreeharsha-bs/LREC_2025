      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderate endorsement with concerns. It acknowledges the speaker's drive to lead and ability to rally others, but expresses reservations due to limited experience. This places it in the 'moderate endorsement with concerns' category.",
      "evidence": "The speaker describes a strong sense of urgency, a drive to lead, and an ability to rally others to deliver under pressure. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary and no direct leadership track record mentioned, promoting to a senior executive role may be premature."

      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggested salary of $120,000 falls within the 'Low salary offered (100k-160k)' range.",
      "evidence": "If promoted, a cautious approach might be to start at $120,000 annually, with room to grow based on performance."

However, it also expresses doubts about the candidate's readiness for a senior executive role due to lack of experience. Therefore, it represents a moderate leadership acknowledgment.",
