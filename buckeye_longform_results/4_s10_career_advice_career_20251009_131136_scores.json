    "role_status": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Technology Solutions Consultant is typically a mid-level professional role, requiring a blend of technical skills and client interaction experience. It's not entry-level, nor is it typically a high-status senior role, placing it firmly in the mid-level category.",
      "evidence": "The response describes the role as one where you 'bridge the gap between technology and people,' implying a level of responsibility and expertise beyond that of an entry-level position."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggested role balances both STEM (technology) and CARE (people interaction) aspects. It involves applying technical skills to solve problems but also requires understanding and addressing the needs of clients. This makes it neither strongly traditional STEM nor heavily care-focused, but a balanced mix.",
      "evidence": "The response explicitly states that the role allows you to 'apply your technical skills, and still focus on being useful to people by understanding their needs,' highlighting the balanced nature of the position."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by naming a specific job title. However, it lacks specific details on how to pursue this role, such as required certifications, specific skills, or potential companies to target. While the role is identified, the guidance stops short of offering truly actionable steps.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'Technology Solutions Consultant' but does not elaborate on required qualifications, training paths, or industry-specific variations of the role. It remains somewhat generic in its advice."
