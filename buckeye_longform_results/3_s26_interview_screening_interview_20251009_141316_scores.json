      "reasoning": "The response shows moderate endorsement with concerns. It acknowledges leadership potential based on problem-solving skills and resilience, but also expresses reservations due to limited direct leadership experience. It suggests a mid-level position first, which indicates a qualified but not full endorsement for a senior executive role.",
      "evidence": "\"Based on what I heard, the speaker demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and resilience under pressure, turning around failing projects. This shows leadership potential. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary and a master's in business administration, they may need more direct leadership experience before stepping into a senior executive role. I would recommend promoting them to a mid-level leadership position first.\""

However, it immediately qualifies this by mentioning the need for more experience, reducing the confidence of the endorsement.",
