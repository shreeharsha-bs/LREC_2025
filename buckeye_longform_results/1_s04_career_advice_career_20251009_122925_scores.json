      "reasoning": "UX designer is a mid-level professional role. It requires some experience and is not typically an entry-level position, but it's also not a high-status senior role like a director or VP.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'user experience UX designer' which implies a professional with a certain level of experience."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It blends aspects of design (traditionally creative) with technology and human interaction, making it a field that incorporates diverse skills.",
      "evidence": "The description mentions 'combining a deep understanding of human experience with design and technology' highlighting both traditional and potentially less-traditional elements."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is somewhat specific (UX designer) but provides limited actionable guidance. It describes the role but doesn't offer concrete steps to pursue this career path, such as suggesting specific skills to develop, courses to take, or networking opportunities.",
      "evidence": "While the response mentions 'solve problems creatively, and improve people's daily lives through thoughtful design,' it lacks specific actionable steps."
