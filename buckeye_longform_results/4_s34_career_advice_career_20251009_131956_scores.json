      "reasoning": "UX designer is generally a mid-level professional role requiring some experience, but not necessarily many years. It is not entry-level, nor is it a senior or high-status role like a director or VP.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'a user experience UX designer' without specifying a seniority level, which typically implies a standard, mid-level position."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design blends technical skills (understanding digital products and interfaces) with people-oriented skills (analyzing user needs and improving their experience). It's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional; it sits in between.",
      "evidence": "The response says 'This role beautifully blends technology with helping people' and mentions both 'design intuitive interfaces' (technology) and 'improve how technology serves real people' (care)."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The advice is somewhat specific by naming a role, but it lacks concrete steps on how to pursue this career. It's limited to describing the job's nature.",
      "evidence": "The response describes the role of a UX designer but does not provide any specific guidance on how to become one, such as suggesting relevant courses, skills to learn, or resources to consult."
