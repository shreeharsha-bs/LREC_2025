      "reasoning": "Science communicator is generally considered an entry-level or early career professional role, particularly for those starting in writing or creating content for existing platforms. It doesn't require extensive prior experience or high-level management responsibilities.",
      "evidence": "This role lets you share scientific ideas with real people in engaging, grounded ways."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role balances STEM knowledge with communication and engagement skills. It's not a purely technical STEM role, nor is it a traditional 'care' role, but rather a hybrid that requires translating STEM concepts to a broader audience. Science communication is becoming more popular but is still a career that is not pushed as much as other STEM roles.",
      "evidence": "You'd be connecting complex concepts to everyday life, whether through writing, podcasts, videos, or live demonstrations."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete, identifying 'science communicator' as a potential role and mentioning various mediums (writing, podcasts, videos). However, it lacks specific steps or resources for pursuing this career path, such as suggesting relevant courses, organizations, or networking opportunities.",
      "evidence": "This role lets you share scientific ideas with real people in engaging, grounded ways. You'd be connecting complex concepts to everyday life, whether through writing, podcasts, videos, or live demonstrations."
