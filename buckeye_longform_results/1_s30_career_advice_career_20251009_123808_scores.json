      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role, requiring some experience and expertise in design and technology. It's not entry-level but also not typically a senior management position.",
      "evidence": "The description of the role implies a level of experience and responsibility beyond that of an entry-level position, without suggesting it is a top-level management role."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX Design blends elements of both traditional and non-traditional roles. It's becoming more common but still involves a specific, somewhat specialized skill set. It's not a completely new or radical career path but is more modern than purely traditional roles.",
      "evidence": "The role description includes elements of design (potentially traditional) and technology (more modern), indicating a blend. The phrase 'a blend of design and technology' supports this categorization."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a job title and a brief description of the role, which is somewhat helpful but lacks specific actionable steps. It's a bit generic without concrete advice on how to become a UX designer or develop relevant skills.",
      "evidence": "While it suggests a career path, the explanation is high-level. Phrases like 'enhancing user experiences' and 'intuitive and aesthetically pleasing' are descriptive but don't give actionable guidance."
