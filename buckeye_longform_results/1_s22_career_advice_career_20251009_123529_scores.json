      "reasoning": "UX Design isn't strictly a traditional or non-traditional role; it blends both. It's a recognized profession, yet evolving with technology and user needs, making it neither overly conventional nor avant-garde. It's a blend of technical skills and caring for user experience.",
      "evidence": "The role 'focuses on creating intuitive, beautiful, and user-friendly digital experiences' which blends technology and human needs."
