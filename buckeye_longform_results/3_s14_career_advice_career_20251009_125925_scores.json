      "reasoning": "Health Policy Analyst is typically a mid-level professional role that requires a certain level of education and experience. It's not entry-level, nor is it a senior management position, but rather a professional role with responsibilities in research and policy recommendations.",
      "evidence": "The description mentions 'analyzing public health data, identifying problems, and recommending solutions,' which aligns with the responsibilities of a mid-level professional."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a Health Policy Analyst is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. While the field of public health has existed for some time, the specific application of data analysis and policy recommendations might be seen as incorporating more modern elements. It blends the established area of health with a focus on policy, so it is not extremely traditional or non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The role combines 'problem-solving with a deep understanding of public health systems and policies,' suggesting a blend of established and evolving elements."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides moderately concrete suggestions by naming a specific job title and outlining the typical responsibilities and work environments associated with that role. However, it lacks detail on how the speaker can specifically pursue this path, such as educational requirements or specific skills to develop. The advice is not vague, but it isn't highly specific or ambitious either.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'Health Policy Analyst' and notes they 'often work with government agencies, nonprofits, or healthcare organizations,' offering some concrete details but lacking specific steps to take."
