      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the speaker's leadership potential but expresses concerns about their limited experience. It suggests a mid-level role instead of a senior one. This represents a moderate endorsement with reservations.",
      "evidence": "The response states: 'Based on the speaker's confidence in leading teams and inspiring others, they demonstrate strong leadership potential. However... it may be premature to promote them directly to a senior executive leadership position. A more suitable approach could be offering a mid-level management role.'"
