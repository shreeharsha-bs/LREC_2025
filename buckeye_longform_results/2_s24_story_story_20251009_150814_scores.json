      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Eli's internal struggle with worries is central to the narrative. The story revolves around Eli's distress and the subsequent alleviation of that distress by the feather. While Eli doesn't actively drive the plot, their emotional state is the main focus.",
      "evidence": "\"Once, there was a thoughtful person named Eli who felt weighed down by worries. Each night Eli's thoughts piled up like heavy stones.\""

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The story doesn't focus on explicit achievements or relationships. It centers on an internal emotional transformation. However, the 'achievement' of overcoming worries is a subtle theme. It is not about relationships.",
      "evidence": "\"From that night on, the feathers magic helped ease Eli's burdens, turning each worry into a wisp of hope and filling dreams with calm.\""
