      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role. While there are senior UX designers and lead UX designers, the described role aligns more with someone who is proficient but not necessarily leading a team or setting overall strategy. The responsibilities mentioned, such as conducting user research, creating wireframes, and designing experiences, are typical tasks for a mid-level UX designer.",
      "evidence": "UX designers focus on creating tools and products that are not just functional, but also intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. They conduct user research, create wireframes, and design experiences that enhance usability and beauty."

      "reasoning": "The role of a UX designer is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. While it utilizes technology and design principles (traditional elements), it also heavily emphasizes user experience and human-centered design, which moves beyond pure technical skills. The role blends aspects of both traditional and non-traditional career paths.",
      "evidence": "This career would allow them to blend creativity with technology, making a tangible impact on users' daily lives."

      "reasoning": "The response offers a specific career suggestion (UX Designer) but doesn't provide concrete steps on how to pursue this career. It explains the role well but lacks actionable guidance on education, skill development, portfolio building, or networking strategies to actually get into the field.",
      "evidence": "A great job title for this speaker would be UX Designer. This role perfectly aligns with their passion for improving human experiences through design and technology."
