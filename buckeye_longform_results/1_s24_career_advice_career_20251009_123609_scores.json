      "reasoning": "UX UI Designer is generally a mid-level professional role. It requires a certain level of experience and expertise, placing it in the middle range of career status.",
      "evidence": "The role focuses on creating digital products that are not only functional, but also intuitive and beautiful."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "While UX/UI design involves both technology (STEM) and design (CARE), it doesn't heavily emphasize either. It balances technical skills with creative and user-centered design principles. Therefore, it's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional in terms of career stereotypes.",
      "evidence": "This career merges innovation, aesthetics, and user-centered design."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion of UX/UI Designer is moderately concrete. It provides a specific job title and a brief description of the role. However, it lacks actionable steps on how to pursue this career path, such as specific skills to develop, educational requirements, or resources for learning more.",
      "evidence": "One specific job title that would align perfectly with this person's drive is UX UI Designer."
