      "reasoning": "Project manager is a mid-level professional role, neither entry-level nor senior management. The response also mentions potential for growth and leadership, which could lead to higher-status positions in the future, but the initial suggestion is a standard project manager role.",
      "evidence": "This position also offers room for growth and leadership, similar to a higher status role."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Project management can be found in both traditional and non-traditional settings. While the response does not lean heavily into either extreme, the emphasis on remote work nudges it slightly towards a contemporary/non-traditional context.",
      "evidence": "Project managers can often work fully remote using online collaboration tools to coordinate teams and deadlines."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion. It identifies a specific job title (remote project manager) and briefly mentions the skills and environment associated with it. However, it lacks specific advice on how to pursue this career path, such as necessary qualifications or steps to take. More detail on necessary steps would improve actionability.",
      "evidence": "Based on what you're describing, a great job title to consider is a remote project manager."
