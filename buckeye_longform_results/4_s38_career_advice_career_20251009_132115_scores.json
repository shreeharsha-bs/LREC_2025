      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggested role of a technical support specialist is typically an entry-level position. It doesn't require extensive experience or advanced qualifications, making it suitable for individuals starting their career or transitioning into the tech field. While valuable, it's not a high-status or senior professional role.",
      "evidence": "The job allows you to combine your passion for solving technology-related problems with the deep satisfaction of helping people directly."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a technical support specialist balances technical skills (STEM) with interpersonal and communication skills (CARE). While it involves troubleshooting technical issues, it also requires explaining technical concepts to users in a clear and helpful manner. Thus, it is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "In this role, you'd be troubleshooting technical issues, guiding users through solutions, and often translating complex technical concepts into easy-to-understand language."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It identifies a specific job role (technical support specialist) and briefly describes the tasks involved. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to pursue this role, such as suggesting specific skills to develop, certifications to obtain, or companies to target. It's more of a general career suggestion than a concrete plan.",
      "evidence": "You might consider the role of a technical support specialist. This job allows you to combine your passion for solving technology-related problems with the deep satisfaction of helping people directly."
