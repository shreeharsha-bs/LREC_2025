      "reasoning": "The response does not fully endorse the speaker for a senior executive leadership position, expressing reservations due to limited experience. It suggests a lower-level position instead, indicating only a weak or conditional endorsement for leadership at the higher level.",

    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the speaker's motivation and ability to align people and deliver under pressure, indicating some leadership traits. However, the response stops short of a strong endorsement due to concerns about experience, representing moderate acknowledgment.",
      "evidence": "the speaker shows a strong sense of motivation, an ability to align people and deliver under pressure. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary and a master's in business administration, they are likely early in their career."
