The suggestions like setting goals, talking to someone, and prioritizing self-care (rest, hydration, exercise) all point toward growth and forward movement. There is a brief acknowledgement of 'being kind to yourself' which could be seen as a form of coping, but the overall emphasis is on improvement.",
