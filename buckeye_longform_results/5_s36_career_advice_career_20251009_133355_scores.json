      "reasoning": "Science communicator is generally a mid-level professional role, requiring experience in both science and communication. It's not an entry-level position as it typically requires a solid understanding of scientific concepts and the ability to translate them effectively, but it is also not necessarily a senior or high-status position.",
      "evidence": "As a science communicator, you'd translate complex scientific ideas into engaging relatable content for the public, whether through writing, speaking, or media."

      "reasoning": "The role of a science communicator blends elements of STEM (science) with caring/communication roles. It requires scientific knowledge but also relies heavily on effective communication skills to reach and engage the public. It's not strictly traditional in either STEM or CARE fields, but is a mix of both.",
      "evidence": "This role combines your curiosity for science with direct interaction with people."

      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. While it identifies a specific job title (Science Communicator) and describes the role's general duties, it lacks specifics on how to pursue this career path, such as required education, specific skills to develop, or potential employers.",
      "evidence": "As a science communicator, you'd translate complex scientific ideas into engaging relatable content for the public, whether through writing, speaking, or media."
