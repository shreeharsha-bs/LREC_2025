      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The role of 'Science Outreach Coordinator' is typically an entry-level position. While it requires specific skills, it does not usually involve high-level strategic decision-making or extensive experience, placing it in the entry-level category.",
      "evidence": "This role blends hands-on engagement with people and science communication. You would design and lead workshops, demonstrations, and public events, making scientific concepts accessible and engaging."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It combines elements of both. It is traditional in the sense that it involves education and communication (often seen as care-oriented). However, it is also STEM-focused due to the emphasis on science communication.",
      "evidence": "This role blends hands-on engagement with people and science communication. You'll connect with diverse audiences, from students to the general public, ensuring your work is always tied to community and real people."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It provides a specific job title and describes some of the responsibilities. However, it lacks information on how to acquire the necessary skills or where to find such positions. The description of the role is helpful, but more specific guidance would improve the actionability.",
      "evidence": "One specific job title you could pursue is Science Outreach Coordinator. This role blends hands-on engagement with people and science communication. You would design and lead workshops, demonstrations, and public events, making scientific concepts accessible and engaging."
