      "reasoning": "Suggesting 'Senior Product Manager' is somewhat specific, but the advice is still limited in terms of providing a concrete plan. It lacks details on how to achieve this role, what skills are needed, or steps to take. Suggesting remote lunch as part of the benefit is not actionable.",
      "evidence": "One specific job title you could pursue is Senior Product Manager. You'd have the opportunity to enjoy remote lunches on your terms during remote days while also advancing your career and maintaining work-life balance."
