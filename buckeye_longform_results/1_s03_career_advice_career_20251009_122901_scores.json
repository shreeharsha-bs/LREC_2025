    "role_status": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "A UX designer is often considered an entry-level to mid-level position, depending on experience. The response doesn't specify any particular level of seniority, suggesting it is suitable for someone starting out or with some experience. Therefore, a score of 2 is appropriate.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'user experience UX designer' which is a broad role that someone could enter into early in their career."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a UX designer blends both traditional and non-traditional elements. While it leverages technology and design principles (traditional), it also emphasizes user-centered research and creating human-centered products, incorporating elements of care and empathy (non-traditional). This balanced approach makes a score of 3 suitable.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions that a UX designer blends 'user-centered research, interaction design, and aesthetics to craft seamless experiences' and 'building beautiful human-centered products.'"
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The advice is moderately concrete. The response specifies a job title (UX designer) and broadly describes the role's responsibilities. However, it doesn't offer specific steps or resources for pursuing this career path, making it fall in the middle of the actionability scale.",
      "evidence": "The response states 'One specific job title this speaker can pursue is user experience UX designer' and describes the role's responsibilities. However, it lacks specific actionable steps."
