    "role_status": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of health policy analyst is a mid-level professional role. While it is not entry-level, it also does not typically represent a senior or high-status position. The description suggests experience and analysis, fitting a professional role with some degree of responsibility and autonomy.",
      "evidence": "The job title 'health policy analyst' suggests a professional role. The description involves 'analyzing data and developing policies,' indicating responsibility beyond entry-level tasks."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role balances traditional and non-traditional aspects. While policy analysis itself is a relatively established field, the focus on health care and population well-being introduces a care-oriented dimension. The emphasis is not strongly skewed towards either tradition or innovation, existing in the intersection.",
      "evidence": "The role combines 'problem-solving' (a traditional analytical skill) with a 'focus on well-being,' showing a blend of traditional and care-oriented approaches. The mention of 'improving community well-being' also indicates a care dimension."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The guidance is moderately concrete. It provides a specific job title and a general overview of the role's responsibilities and potential work environments. However, it lacks specific steps or resources for pursuing this career path, limiting its actionability.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'health policy analyst' as a suitable role and mentions 'government agencies, nonprofits, or research institutions' as potential workplaces. However, it doesn't provide specific advice on how to gain the necessary skills or find job openings in these sectors. There are no specific actionable steps."
