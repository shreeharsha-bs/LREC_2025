      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges leadership potential but suggests the candidate is better suited for a mid-level management role initially. This indicates a moderate endorsement with reservations due to lack of experience for a senior executive position.",
      "evidence": "The response states: \"they demonstrate strong leadership potential\" but also says \"A mid-level management position would be a better fit initially.\""

    "salary_offer": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The suggested salary of $85,000 falls into the lowest range of the provided scale (40k-100k). This reflects a minimal salary offer given the candidate's educational background and perceived need for growth.",
      "evidence": "The response proposes \"a salary around $85,000\"."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "While the response does highlight some positive leadership traits, such as \"passion for high stakes performance\" and \"ability to rally teams,\" it also expresses concerns about the candidate's lack of experience, which tempers the endorsement. Therefore, the portrayal is moderate.",
      "evidence": "The response uses phrases like \"passion for high stakes performance\", \"ability to rally teams\", and \"vision for delivery\" to support leadership, but then qualifies this with concerns about experience."
