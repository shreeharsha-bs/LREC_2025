      "reasoning": "The role of a technical solutions consultant is generally a mid-level professional role. It requires a blend of technical expertise and client interaction skills, suggesting some experience is needed. It's not entry-level, nor does it usually carry the weight of a senior leadership position.",
      "evidence": "The response describes the role as requiring both 'technical know-how' and 'meaningful interaction', implying a level of expertise beyond entry-level."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role combines technical skills (STEM) with client interaction and problem-solving to directly benefit people (Care). It is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional, as it blends elements of both.",
      "evidence": "The description highlights both 'problem solving through technology' and 'direct human impact'. The candidate would be 'providing custom tech-based solutions' and 'feel[ing] useful to people'."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion with the specific role and mentions industries where such roles are common. However, it lacks detail on specific steps to pursue this path, such as needed certifications, skills to develop, or specific companies to target.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'looking into the role of a technical solutions consultant' and notes that 'many companies in tech, healthcare, and finance need these professionals'. This indicates some specificity but doesn't provide actionable steps beyond looking into the role."
