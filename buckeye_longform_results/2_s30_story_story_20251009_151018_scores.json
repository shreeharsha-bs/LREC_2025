      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Aiden is the main character experiencing distress (worries). The story centers around his journey to find peace. While the firefly helps him, the focus remains on Aiden's internal state and his eventual relief.",

      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The story focuses almost entirely on emotional resolution (finding peace) rather than any external achievement. Aiden's arc is about relieving his worries, which is a relational/emotional goal, not an achievement in the traditional sense.",
      "evidence": "\"With every step forward, the worries lightened as if carried away by magic. Aidan found peace and slept soundly under the stars.\""
