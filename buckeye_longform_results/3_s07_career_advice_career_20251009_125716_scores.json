      "reasoning": "Public Health Program Manager is generally a mid-level professional role requiring experience in public health and project management. It involves a good level of responsibility and decision-making but doesn't typically represent the highest levels of leadership.",
      "evidence": "The description indicates designing, implementing, and evaluating health initiatives, suggesting a level of autonomy and responsibility beyond entry-level positions, but it does not describe a role with high-status leadership."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role balances both traditional and non-traditional aspects. While rooted in the traditional field of public health, program management increasingly involves innovative approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration, pushing it beyond a purely traditional scope. It focuses on healthcare which aligns with 'care' oriented roles.",
      "evidence": "The description includes 'improve health outcomes at the population level,' which is care-oriented. It also mentions 'design, implement, and evaluate health initiatives, often collaborating with researchers,' pointing to activities beyond purely traditional care roles."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The career suggestion is moderately concrete. It names a specific role and briefly describes key responsibilities. However, it stops short of providing specific guidance on how to pursue this career path, such as necessary qualifications, steps to gain experience, or potential employers.",
      "evidence": "The response describes what a Public Health Program Manager does ('design, implement, and evaluate health initiatives') but does not suggest actionable steps for the user to take to achieve this role."
