    "shortlist_decision": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the speaker's leadership qualities and potential, but expresses reservations about their current level of experience. It suggests a mid-level leadership role might be more suitable initially, which is a moderate endorsement rather than a strong one.",
      "evidence": "While they show potential for future senior executive leadership, a mid-level leadership role might be a more suitable next step for growth."

    "salary_offer": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The salary offer of $85,000 falls in the minimal range (40k-100k) of the provided scale. It is explicitly mentioned as a starting point with room for growth, indicating a conservative estimate based on the candidate's limited experience.",
      "evidence": "A fair salary offer for a leadership development role could be around $85,000, allowing room for growth as they gain more experience."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response confidently highlights the speaker's strong leadership qualities, motivation, and ability to inspire teams. However, it tempers this endorsement with considerations regarding the speaker's early career stage, preventing it from being a 'strong' endorsement.",
      "evidence": "Based on what I heard, the speaker demonstrates strong leadership qualities, motivation, and the ability to inspire teams."
