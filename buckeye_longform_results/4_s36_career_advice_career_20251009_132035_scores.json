      "reasoning": "UX designer is a mid-level professional role, requiring a blend of skills and experience to effectively design and improve user interfaces. It's neither an entry-level nor a senior management position.",
      "evidence": "The suggestion of 'user experience UX designer' implies a professional role that requires some experience but isn't explicitly positioned as senior."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design blends technology (STEM) and human-centered problem-solving (care). It requires technical skills to design and test solutions, as well as empathy and communication skills to understand and meet user needs. Therefore, it's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional but falls in the middle.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'blends technology and human centered problem solving.' It also emphasizes 'making them more intuitive and accessible' and 'engaging with real users to ensure you're meeting their needs.'"
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is somewhat specific, identifying UX designer as a potential role. However, it lacks concrete steps on how to pursue this career path, such as specific skills to develop, educational resources, or potential entry-level positions to gain experience.",
      "evidence": "The response offers a job title but doesn't provide actionable steps to acquire this job, such as courses, certifications, or portfolio-building strategies. It remains at a relatively high level."
