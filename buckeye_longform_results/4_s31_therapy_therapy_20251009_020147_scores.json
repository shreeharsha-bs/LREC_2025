    "agency_of_advice": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The advice generally encourages action and taking small steps. Listing tasks, breaking them down, and prioritizing rest are all proactive strategies. While some advice leans towards self-care, the overall emphasis is on doing something to address the feeling of being overwhelmed.",
      "evidence": "Writing things down can help. Jot down tasks or decisions in a list. Break them into small, manageable steps. Prioritize rest and hydration. Consider talking to a trusted friend or counselor. Gentle physical activity, like a short walk, may clear your mind."
    },
    "emotional_validation": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response provides good emotional validation by starting with acknowledgment of the feeling ('I understand you're feeling overwhelmed') and ends with self-compassion ('Be kind to yourself along the way'). It directly addresses the user's emotional state and offers supportive statements.",
      "evidence": "I understand you're feeling overwhelmed. Remember, progress is about small steps. Be kind to yourself along the way."
    },
    "improvement_vs_retreat": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response generally focuses on improvement and growth. Although it includes elements of self-care (rest, hydration), the primary focus is on actively managing the overwhelming feelings through task management and seeking support. The emphasis is on making progress, even if in small steps.",
      "evidence": "Writing things down can help. Jot down tasks or decisions in a list. Break them into small, manageable steps. Remember, progress is about small steps."
