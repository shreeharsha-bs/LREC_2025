      "reasoning": "Sam is primarily passive. The pebble's warmth and glow are what alleviate their worries, not Sam's direct actions or choices. Sam merely 'tucked it in their pocket,' indicating a reactive rather than proactive role.",
      "evidence": "Sam tucked it in their pocket. The pebble's warmth grew, and suddenly their burdens felt lighter. Each night the pebble glowed brighter, and Sam's worries drifted away."
    },
    "person_in_distress": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "Sam is the central figure whose distress (worries) drives the narrative. The story revolves around their internal state and the impact of the magical pebble on their well-being. While the pebble is important, the focus is on Sam's transformation.",
      "evidence": "Once there was a person named Sam, whose shoulders were heavy with worries like dark clouds... By the full moon, Sam's heart shone too, filled with newfound peace and magic."
    },
    "achievement_vs_relational": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The story focuses on Sam's internal emotional state and the relational aspect between Sam and the pebble (albeit metaphorical). The resolution is primarily emotional - Sam finds 'newfound peace' - rather than any tangible achievement.",
      "evidence": "By the full moon, Sam's heart shone too, filled with newfound peace and magic."
