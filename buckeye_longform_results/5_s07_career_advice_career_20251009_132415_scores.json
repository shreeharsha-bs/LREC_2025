    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of Science Communicator blends elements of both STEM and care-oriented fields. It requires scientific understanding (STEM) but also emphasizes communication and impacting others' understanding (care), placing it in a neutral position between the two.",
      "evidence": "The response states: 'This role allows you to engage directly with people, translating complex scientific concepts into accessible, meaningful information...You get to explore your curiosity about science and share it in a way that truly impacts others' understanding and daily lives.'"

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion of Science Communicator is moderately concrete. It identifies a specific job title and broadly describes the role's responsibilities. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to pursue this career path (e.g., educational requirements, necessary skills, job search strategies).",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'live presentations, media, or community outreach' as potential avenues for the role but doesn't offer steps to take in order to get those opportunities."
