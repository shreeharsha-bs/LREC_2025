      "reasoning": "Epidemiologist is generally a mid-level professional role requiring a master's degree or higher and some years of experience. It's not an entry-level or high-status position but a solid professional career.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'Epidemiologist', a role that requires significant education and experience beyond entry-level but isn't necessarily a top executive or leadership role."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Epidemiology is a blend of STEM fields like biology and statistics with care-oriented aspects related to public health and community well-being. The role involves both scientific investigation and improving health outcomes, positioning it in the middle of the traditional vs. non-traditional spectrum.",
      "evidence": "The response highlights the STEM aspect ('data to solve real-world health problems') and the care aspect ('improve community health')."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a specific job title, which is better than generic advice. However, it lacks concrete steps on how to pursue this career, such as specific educational requirements, necessary skills, or potential employers. It's somewhat specific but lacks actionable guidance.",
      "evidence": "It suggests 'Epidemiologist' as a possible role but does not provide specifics on how to become one or resources for further exploration."
