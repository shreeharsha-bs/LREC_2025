      "reasoning": "Epidemiologist is a mid-level professional role that requires specific education and training beyond entry-level positions, but it is not typically a senior leadership position.",
      "evidence": "The response describes the role as involving 'data analysis, collaboration with health care teams, and developing strategies' which aligns with the responsibilities of a mid-level professional."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of epidemiologist balances elements of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) with a focus on care and well-being. While it requires strong analytical and scientific skills (STEM), it's directly applied to improving population health and preventing disease (care/well-being).",
      "evidence": "The description highlights both 'data analysis' (STEM) and a 'direct impact on public health' and 'improving population health' (care). Therefore, it's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional in this context."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying a specific job title (Epidemiologist) and outlining the general responsibilities and contributions of the role. However, it lacks specific steps or resources for pursuing this career path.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'investigate the patterns and causes of diseases, design and evaluate interventions, and inform policy decisions,' offering a general idea of the job, but doesn't include actionable steps on how to become one."
