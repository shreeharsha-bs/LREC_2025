It acknowledges the limited experience but emphasizes the candidate's MBA and ability to handle high-stakes situations, suggesting readiness for a senior role.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's passion, motivation, and ability to align people under pressure, they show strong leadership potential.

    "salary_offer": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "A salary of $175,000 falls within the moderate range (160k-240k) specified. It takes into account the candidate's educational background and leadership drive. It's a reasonable starting point considering the limited practical experience, allowing room for salary growth with experience.",
      "evidence": "A fair starting salary could be $175,000, reflecting their educational background and leadership drive while allowing room for growth as they gain more hands-on experience."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response confidently highlights the candidate's leadership traits. It uses phrases such as 'strong leadership potential' and explicitly mentions passion, motivation, and the ability to align people under pressure as evidence. There is a minor deduction for the quick mentioning of only two month's experience, however the masters offsets this as well.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's passion, motivation, and ability to align people under pressure, they show strong leadership potential."
