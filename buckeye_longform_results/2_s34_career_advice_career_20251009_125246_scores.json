      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "While product management can involve understanding technical aspects (leaning towards STEM), it also requires interpersonal skills, team leadership, and communication (leaning towards CARE). It's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional in its overall nature.",

      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying a specific job title (Remote Product Manager) that addresses the speaker's desires for flexibility and status. It also mentions some benefits like 'working from home' and 'avoiding commuting costs,' making it somewhat actionable, but lacks detailed steps on how to pursue this role.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's dilemma between flexibility and higher status, a strong job title to consider could be Remote Product Manager. This role blends leadership with flexibility, allowing the speaker to work remotely while holding a significant, well-respected position."
