      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally an entry-level to mid-level role, but more commonly entry-level. Therefore, it's reasonable to score it as a 2.",

      "reasoning": "UX Design is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It blends elements of both, making it a reasonable '3'. It has a traditional element in that design has always been present. But also, UX design is fairly novel and more tech-based, which skews it as more non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The role mentioned is \"User Experience UX Designer.\" This blends traditional (design) with modern (technology/digital products)."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The plan is moderately concrete. It specifies actions that the role entails, but does not mention how to achieve the role beyond mentioning that it would involve user research, wireframes, and collaboration.",
      "evidence": "The AI response states that the role involves \"conduct[ing] user research, creat[ing] wireframes, and collaborat[ing] with developers and product teams to bring designs to life.\""
