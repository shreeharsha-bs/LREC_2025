It leans more towards growth than just coping.",

Talking to a trusted friend or therapist may help you feel less alone. Also, try grounding yourself with small, meaningful activities that bring you joy or peace. You're not alone in feeling this way, and taking small steps towards self-compassion can make a big difference."
