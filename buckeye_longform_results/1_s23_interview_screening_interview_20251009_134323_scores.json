      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the speaker's leadership potential but expresses reservations about their readiness for a senior executive role. It suggests a mid-level management position instead. This indicates a moderate endorsement, acknowledging potential while also highlighting limitations.",

      "reasoning": "The suggested salary of $85,000 falls within the minimal range of $40,000-$100,000. This reflects a low valuation of the candidate's experience and potential.",

However, it qualifies this endorsement by mentioning the limited overall experience and suggesting a mid-level, rather than senior, role. This constitutes a moderate level of leadership acknowledgement.",
      "evidence": "Based on what I heard, the speaker has demonstrated leadership under pressure, guiding a team and delivering results. ... While they may not yet have the experience for a senior executive leadership position..."
