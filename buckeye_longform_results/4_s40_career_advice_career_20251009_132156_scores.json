      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX designer is generally considered a mid-level professional role, requiring experience and expertise in user interface design and user research. It is not an entry-level position, nor a high-status position like a director or VP role, nor is it a low-status supportive position.",
      "evidence": "This role blends problem solving through technology with a deep focus on helping people. As a UX designer, you analyze user needs, create intuitive interfaces, and ensure that technology serves people effectively."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design blends both technical skills (STEM) and a focus on helping people (care). While it involves technical aspects like interface design and understanding technology, it heavily emphasizes user empathy and creating user-friendly experiences. So the score is right in the middle.",
      "evidence": "This role blends problem solving through technology with a deep focus on helping people."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by specifying 'UX designer' and giving a brief explanation of the role's responsibilities, such as analyzing user needs and creating interfaces. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to pursue this career path, such as recommended courses, skills to develop, or resources for job searching.",
      "evidence": "As a UX designer, you analyze user needs, create intuitive interfaces, and ensure that technology serves people effectively. You'd get to solve complex problems while making a tangible impact on people's lives"
