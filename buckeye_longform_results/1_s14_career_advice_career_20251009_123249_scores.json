      "reasoning": "UX Designer is typically an entry-level position, though experience can lead to higher levels. The description doesn't suggest a senior role or management position.",
      "evidence": "The response describes the role as one where the person will 'collaborate with developers, researchers, and product teams'. This suggests a role that works within a team rather than leading it, indicative of an entry to mid-level position."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX Design blends elements of both traditional and non-traditional roles. It is related to design and technology but also requires soft skills like empathy and communication. Thus, it is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The response states 'This role combines your passion for improving human experiences with design and technology.' This statement shows the combination of technological and human-centered aspects of the job."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The advice is moderately concrete. It names a specific job title and broadly outlines responsibilities but doesn't offer guidance on how to pursue this role or the necessary steps to take.",
      "evidence": "The response identifies 'UX Designer' as a possible role and says you'll 'shape how people interact with technology' and 'collaborate with developers'. This is moderately concrete but lacks actionable steps."
