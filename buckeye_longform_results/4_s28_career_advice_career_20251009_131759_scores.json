      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of 'healthcare technology specialist' is a mid-level professional role. It requires a blend of technical skills and healthcare knowledge, suggesting some experience is needed but not necessarily at a senior management level.",
      "evidence": "The description includes tasks such as 'implementing electronic health record systems, training medical staff on new tools or optimizing health tech,' which are typical responsibilities of a mid-level professional."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggested role combines aspects of both traditional and non-traditional careers. Healthcare has been a traditional field, but the technology aspect represents a more modern and evolving area within that field. It is not heavily skewed towards either.",
      "evidence": "The role 'merges your passion for solving problems with technology and your desire to be useful to people' shows a balance between technological innovation and traditional care values."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides moderately concrete suggestions. It mentions specific tasks like 'implementing electronic health record systems' and 'training medical staff,' which are helpful. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to obtain the necessary skills or find relevant job opportunities.",
      "evidence": "While the response mentions potential responsibilities and the impact of the role, it doesn't provide detailed steps on how to pursue this career path."
