      "reasoning": "Science Communicator is a mid-level professional role, requiring a combination of scientific knowledge and communication skills. It isn't an entry-level or high-status position, but a established professional role.",
      "evidence": "This role involves translating complex scientific ideas into engaging accessible information for the public."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role balances scientific knowledge (STEM) with human interaction and communication (CARE). It is not heavily skewed towards either traditional STEM or pure CARE roles, placing it in a neutral position.",
      "evidence": "It's grounded in human interaction, whether through writing, workshops, media, or community outreach. It allows someone with a passion for science to engage directly with real people, bridging the gap between theory and everyday life."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion of 'Science Communicator.' It outlines the general responsibilities and the nature of the work. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to pursue this career path (e.g., necessary qualifications, potential employers, resources for training).",
      "evidence": "One specific job title to consider is Science Communicator. This role involves translating complex scientific ideas into engaging accessible information for the public."
