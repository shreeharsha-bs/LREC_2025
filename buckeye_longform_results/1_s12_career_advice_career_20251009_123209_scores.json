      "reasoning": "UX Designer is typically a mid-level professional role. It requires some experience in design and technology, but it's not usually considered a senior or high-status position unless the individual is leading a team or has significant influence on product strategy.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'User Experience UX Designer' which typically requires some experience, making it a mid-level position."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. It is an established field that blends design principles with technological understanding and user-centered approaches. While the specific technologies and trends within UX design may evolve, the core principles remain relatively consistent.",
      "evidence": "The job role combines 'design thinking, technology, and empathy'. It's not fully traditional as it involves tech but not fully non-traditional as design is a pretty established field."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It identifies a specific job title (UX Designer) and briefly explains what the role entails. However, it lacks specific actionable steps the speaker could take to pursue this career path, such as suggesting relevant courses, skills to develop, or portfolio building strategies.",
      "evidence": "The suggestion to become a 'User Experience UX Designer' is more than generic advice, but still not that actionable. The response does not go into detail on how to pursue the suggested career path."
