      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role. It requires experience and a portfolio of work, but it's not typically considered a senior or high-status position.",
      "evidence": "The suggestion of 'User Experience UX Designer' implies a role that requires some experience but is not necessarily a leadership or executive position."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design blends technical skills (STEM) with a focus on user needs and human-centered design (CARE). It is not strongly one or the other, representing a balance.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'design thinking, user research, and technology' which covers both aspects."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a reasonably concrete suggestion of UX Designer, explaining the responsibilities and relevance. While it's not incredibly detailed in terms of specific steps, it provides enough information to understand what the role entails.",
      "evidence": "The response states that the role 'focuses on creating digital products and tools that are not only functional, but also intuitive, beautiful, and centered on the human experience.' It also specifies that a UX designer 'combines design thinking, user research, and technology'."
