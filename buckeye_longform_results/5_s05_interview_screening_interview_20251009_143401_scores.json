      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the speaker's leadership qualities and potential for a senior executive leadership position, but it also raises concerns about their limited experience. This reflects a moderate endorsement.",
      "evidence": "The phrase 'promoting them to a senior executive leadership position could be justified' indicates a positive inclination, while 'with only two months of experience as a secretary, it's crucial to provide mentorship and development opportunities' highlights the concerns."

      "reasoning": "The offered salary of $180,000 falls within the moderate range (160k-240k) of the scale provided.",
      "evidence": "The response states 'A starting salary of $180,000 would reflect the potential they've shown and encourage growth in the role while balancing the need for further leadership experience.'"

    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges leadership qualities but tempers it with concerns about the speaker's limited experience. The endorsement is not strong but moderate.",
      "evidence": "The phrase 'demonstrated leadership qualities and their ability to inspire teams' suggests recognition of leadership traits. However, this is balanced against their short tenure ('two months of experience as a secretary')."
