The response outlines the general responsibilities and skills required for the job, providing a basic understanding of the role. However, it does not offer specific actionable steps, such as recommending specific courses, certifications, or internships that could help the speaker pursue this career path.",
      "evidence": "Given their interest in well-being and problem solving and their background in medical research or health care, this role aligns well with their skills. Epidemiologists design studies, analyze data, and help implement interventions that improve population health."
