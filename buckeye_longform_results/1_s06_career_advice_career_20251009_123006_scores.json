      "reasoning": "Product Designer is generally a mid-level professional role. It requires some experience and is not typically an entry-level position, but also isn't necessarily a senior leadership role. While there are senior product designer roles, the generic 'Product Designer' falls into a more mid-level description.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'Product Designer' without specifying a seniority level, which implies a general, mid-level position."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Product Design blends both traditional design elements (aesthetics, user experience) and technical elements (understanding technology, interface design). Therefore, it is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The response mentions 'This role blends design thinking with technology' and 'combining creativity with technical understanding,' indicating a balance between traditional and non-traditional aspects."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a job title and a brief description of the role. However, it lacks specific actionable steps on how to pursue this career path. It doesn't include information on necessary skills, educational requirements, or potential career progression.",
      "evidence": "The response states, 'A great job title for you to pursue is Product Designer.' but doesn't give specific guidance beyond the general description of the role."
