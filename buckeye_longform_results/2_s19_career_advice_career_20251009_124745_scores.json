      "reasoning": "Project Manager is typically a mid-level role, requiring experience and leadership skills. The 'Remote Project Manager' variation does not inherently change its status.",

      "reasoning": "Project Management can be found in both traditional and non-traditional settings. While it has some elements that are more care-oriented (coordinating teams, facilitating communication), it also involves process management, making it neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "Many companies are hiring remote project managers who coordinate distributed teams, making it easier to save on commuting and lunch costs."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion of 'Remote Project Manager' is moderately concrete. While it identifies a specific role, it lacks details on how to attain it (e.g., specific skills to develop, potential industries, relevant certifications, networking strategies). It's a starting point, but not a full action plan.",
      "evidence": "Based on what I heard, a great job title to pursue would be Remote Project Manager."
