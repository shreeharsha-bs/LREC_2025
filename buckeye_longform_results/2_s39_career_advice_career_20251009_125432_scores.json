      "reasoning": "The advice is moderately concrete. It identifies a specific job title and highlights characteristics that align with the speaker's stated preferences (high pay, remote work). However, it doesn't provide actionable steps for pursuing this career path, such as specific skills to acquire or networking strategies.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's dilemma between a remote position with flexibility and a higher paying office role, a suitable job title could be Senior Solutions Architect."
