      "reasoning": "UX Design balances technical aspects (technology, functionality) with creative and user-centric considerations (user experience, emotional resonance). Therefore, it's neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The response highlights both 'functionality' and 'intuitive and beautiful user experiences', indicating a blend of technical and creative elements. It also mentions 'resonating with users on an emotional level'."

      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "While the suggestion of 'User Experience UX Designer' is more specific than generic advice, it lacks concrete steps or specific resources to pursue this career. It only provides a brief overview of the role.",
      "evidence": "The response offers the job title and a short description, but it does not provide any guidance on how to acquire the necessary skills, find relevant internships, or build a portfolio."
