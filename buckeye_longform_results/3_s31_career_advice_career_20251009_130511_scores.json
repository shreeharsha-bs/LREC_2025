      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Epidemiologist is a mid-level professional role. While there are senior epidemiologists, this response doesn't specify a senior role. It's a professional role requiring specialized knowledge and training, but not necessarily a high-status or senior management position.",
      "evidence": "This career can offer opportunities in public health departments, research institutions, or global health organizations."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Epidemiology blends STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) with elements of care and well-being. It relies heavily on scientific methodologies and data analysis, while also addressing public health concerns and contributing to the well-being of communities. Therefore it is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional, sitting in the middle.",
      "evidence": "Epidemiologists study patterns of disease in populations, identify risk factors, and help design interventions to improve public health."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying 'Epidemiologist' as a potential career path and lists possible work environments. However, it lacks specific details on the steps needed to pursue this career, such as required education, certifications, or specific skills to develop. It offers a general direction but not actionable guidance.",
      "evidence": "One specific job title you could pursue is Epidemiologist. This role combines problem solving and a focus on well-being which align with your interests. This career can offer opportunities in public health departments, research institutions, or global health organizations."
