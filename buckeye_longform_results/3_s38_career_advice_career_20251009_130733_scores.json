      "reasoning": "A Public Health Program Manager is a mid-level professional role. It requires experience in public health, leadership skills, and the ability to coordinate projects, placing it firmly in the mid-level professional category.",
      "evidence": "The job title 'Public Health Program Manager' implies a level of responsibility and experience beyond entry-level but not at a senior executive level."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of Public Health Program Manager isn't strictly traditional or non-traditional; it blends elements of both. While public health roles are established, the increasing emphasis on community interventions and cross-functional teams brings in a non-traditional aspect.",
      "evidence": "The description includes designing community interventions and coordinating cross-functional teams, which suggests a move beyond purely traditional public health roles. The role also deals with healthcare systems and evidence-based solutions which shows that it's also a traditional role."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by naming a specific job title and outlining how the speaker's interests and skills align with the role's responsibilities. It's not generic, but it could be more actionable with specific steps or resources.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'Public Health Program Manager' and explains how the speaker's 'interest in well-being and problem-solving aligns perfectly with managing health initiatives.' However, it lacks detailed guidance on how to pursue this role."
