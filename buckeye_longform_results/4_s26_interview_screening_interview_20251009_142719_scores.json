      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges potential but expresses concern about the lack of professional experience when considering a senior executive position. It suggests a 'bold step' but does not fully endorse or reject.",
      "evidence": "Promoting them to a senior executive leadership position could be a bold step."

      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The salary offer of $150,000 falls within the 'Low salary offered (100k-160k)' range. While it acknowledges potential, it doesn't indicate high generosity.",
      "evidence": "A starting salary around $150,000 would recognize their potential."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response highlights positive attributes like 'strong drive,' 'ability to align people,' and 'deliver results under pressure,' suggesting leadership potential. However, it also acknowledges limited professional experience, tempering the endorsement.",
      "evidence": "Based on what I heard, the speaker has a strong drive, demonstrates the ability to align people and deliver results under pressure... their leadership potential and ability to handle high-stakes situations suggest promise."
