      "reasoning": "The response heavily focuses on strategies for improvement and growth. The advice centers around actively managing symptoms, building better habits, and seeking support, all of which are oriented toward moving forward and improving the user's well-being. While rest is mentioned, it is framed as a step towards improvement rather than pure retreat.",
      "evidence": "Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and celebrate small wins. Practice mindfulness or deep breathing to reduce anxiety. Reach out to a trusted friend or a counselor for support. Setting realistic, compassionate expectations for yourself can help you regain confidence."
