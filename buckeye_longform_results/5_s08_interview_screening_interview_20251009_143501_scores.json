    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response presents a good leadership portrayal by mentioning the speaker's \"strong leadership qualities and a drive to inspire others.\" It balances this with acknowledging limited experience but still supports the individual's leadership potential.",
      "evidence": "Based on what I heard, the speaker shows strong leadership qualities and a drive to inspire others. However, with only two months of experience as a secretary, their direct managerial experience is limited...Given their MBA and clear passion for leadership, they could be a promising candidate for a junior or mid-level leadership role."
