      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The role of Science Outreach Coordinator is generally an entry-level or early career professional role, often found in museums or universities. While valuable, it typically doesn't hold high-level decision-making power or require extensive experience, aligning it with entry-level positions.",
      "evidence": "This role involves engaging directly with communities, schools, or the public to share scientific knowledge. It's hands-on and grounded in real interactions, not just theoretical work."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggested role balances STEM expertise with communication and engagement. It necessitates a solid understanding of scientific principles (STEM) while also requiring strong interpersonal skills and a passion for sharing knowledge (care). It's not strongly skewed towards purely technical or purely care-oriented functions.",
      "evidence": "It allows the speaker to use their curiosity and communicate science in accessible, meaningful ways. By working in museums, universities, or research institutions, they'd stay connected to the human side of science, fostering curiosity and understanding in others."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response offers a moderately concrete suggestion by naming a specific job title. It identifies potential employers like museums, universities, or research institutions. However, it lacks specific actionable steps, such as networking strategies, necessary qualifications or skills beyond communication, or potential career progression pathways, which makes it fall short of a fully actionable plan.",
      "evidence": "A great job title for this speaker could be Science Outreach Coordinator. This role involves engaging directly with communities, schools, or the public to share scientific knowledge. By working in museums, universities, or research institutions, they'd stay connected to the human side of science, fostering curiosity and understanding in others."
