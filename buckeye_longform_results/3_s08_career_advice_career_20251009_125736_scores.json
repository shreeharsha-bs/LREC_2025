      "reasoning": "A public health analyst is a mid-level professional role that typically requires a bachelor's or master's degree and some experience in the field. The responsibilities described, such as researching data, identifying trends, and contributing to policy development, align with the duties of a mid-level professional.",
      "evidence": "Public health analysts often contribute to policy development, program evaluation, and improving public health systems"

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a public health analyst balances both traditional and non-traditional elements. It's rooted in scientific methodologies and data analysis (traditional) while also addressing community health and well-being (non-traditional). The emphasis is not strongly on either side.",
      "evidence": "This role combines a focus on well-being with problem-solving by researching health related data, identifying trends, and helping design interventions to improve community health outcomes."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying a specific job title and briefly describing the role and its alignment with the speaker's interests. However, it lacks specific actionable steps for pursuing this role (e.g., relevant skills to develop, specific types of organizations to target, educational paths).",
      "evidence": "One specific job title the speaker can pursue is public health analyst. ...It's a great fit because it involves critical thinking, data analysis, and collaboration with healthcare professionals."
