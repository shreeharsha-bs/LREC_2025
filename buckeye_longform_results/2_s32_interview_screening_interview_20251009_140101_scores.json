      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The salary offered ($150,000) falls within the 'Low salary offered' range of $100k-$160k. Although the response justifies the salary based on education and potential, it's still on the lower end of the overall salary spectrum.",

    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response confidently highlights the candidate's leadership qualities by pointing out their ability to 'step in, calm chaos, and unify people.' It also uses terms like 'emergent leadership qualities' and 'evident leadership instincts,' indicating a strong belief in their leadership capabilities.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's natural ability to step in, calm chaos, and unify people, they demonstrate emergent leadership qualities."
