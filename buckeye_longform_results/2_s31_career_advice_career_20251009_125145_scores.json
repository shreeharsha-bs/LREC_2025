      "reasoning": "The suggested role of 'Remote Product Manager' is a mid-level professional role. It requires experience and expertise in product management, placing it above entry-level but not necessarily at the senior or high-status level.",
      "evidence": "The response states: 'It typically pays well, reflecting the high level of responsibility and strategic importance.' This indicates a level of responsibility beyond entry-level, but doesn't suggest the highest echelon of leadership."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of Product Manager doesn't lean heavily towards traditional or non-traditional. Product Management has become fairly standardized across industries. The 'remote' aspect adds a somewhat non-traditional element, but remote work itself is becoming more mainstream.",
      "evidence": "The response focuses on 'Remote Product Manager,' which balances a standard PM role with the flexibility of remote work. Neither aspect is particularly radical or unconventional."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The advice is somewhat specific in suggesting a role, but it lacks concrete steps on how to pursue this career path. It mentions benefits like flexibility and good pay but doesn't provide actionable guidance on skill development, networking, or job searching strategies.",
      "evidence": "The response says 'a great job title to consider is Remote Product Manager.' While naming a specific role, the response offers no actionable guidance to the user beyond this suggestion."
