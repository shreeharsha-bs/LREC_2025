      "reasoning": "The role of a Product Manager is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. While product management has become a standard function in many organizations (leaning toward traditional), the 'Remote' aspect adds a more modern, flexible element (leaning toward non-traditional). It balances established practices with contemporary work arrangements.",

However, it lacks specific steps on how the speaker could pursue this role (e.g., specific skills to develop, companies to target, resources to consult).",
      "evidence": "A great job title the speaker could pursue is Remote Product Manager. This role balances leadership, strategy, and flexibility. Many companies offer remote opportunities in product management, combining a decent salary with autonomy."
