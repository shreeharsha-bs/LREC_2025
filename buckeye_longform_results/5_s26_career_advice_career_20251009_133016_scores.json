      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "Science Communicator is a mid-level professional role. It requires a strong understanding of science and the ability to communicate effectively, suggesting experience and expertise beyond entry-level positions. While it's not a high-status executive role, it's also not a low-status supportive position.",
      "evidence": "The description implies a level of expertise and experience: 'translate complex scientific ideas,' 'foster curiosity and understanding.' This suggests a mid-level professional role."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The Science Communicator role blends traditional and non-traditional aspects. It uses scientific knowledge (STEM), but heavily relies on communication and interpersonal skills (CARE). It is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional, placing it in the middle of the scale.",
      "evidence": "The description highlights both the 'passion for science' and 'meaningful human interaction.' It explicitly mentions translating 'complex scientific ideas into accessible language' implying the need for strong communication skills."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The advice is somewhat specific but limited in its actionability. It suggests a general job title and describes the role, but it does not provide concrete steps or resources to pursue it. There is no mention of specific skills to develop, potential employers, or resources for finding such a role.",
      "evidence": "The response provides a general description: 'engage directly with the public, translate complex scientific ideas into accessible language.' However, it lacks specific actionable steps to achieve this."
