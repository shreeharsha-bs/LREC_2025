      "reasoning": "The roles suggested incorporate elements of both traditional and non-traditional career paths.

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides moderately concrete suggestions by naming specific job titles and suggesting potential workplaces like museums, science centers, or media outlets. However, it lacks specific guidance on how to attain these roles, such as necessary skills, training, or networking opportunities.",
