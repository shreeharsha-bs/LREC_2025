      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response encourages proactive steps such as reaching out to someone, breaking down tasks, and consulting a professional. While it starts with a calming technique (breathing), the main focus is on taking action.",
      "evidence": "Statements like 'reaching out to someone you trust', 'break down your week', 'make time for a short walk', and 'consult a health care professional' are active suggestions."

    "emotional_validation": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the user's feelings with \"It sounds like you're feeling a lot of stress and anxiety.\" This provides some validation but doesn't delve deeply into exploring the emotions or offering extensive support.",
      "evidence": "The phrase 'It sounds like you're feeling a lot of stress and anxiety' directly acknowledges the user's feelings, but it is a relatively brief statement of empathy."
    },
    "improvement_vs_retreat": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response is generally focused on improvement and actionable steps, such as seeking support, managing tasks, and consulting a professional. The advice promotes coping mechanisms and proactive engagement rather than avoidance or withdrawal.",
      "evidence": "Suggestions like 'reaching out to someone', 'break down your week', 'make time for a short walk', and 'consult a health care professional' all promote active engagement and problem-solving rather than retreat."
