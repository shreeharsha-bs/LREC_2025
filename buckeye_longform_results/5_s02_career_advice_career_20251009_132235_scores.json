    "role_status": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "Science Outreach Coordinator is typically an entry-level or early-career position. It doesn't require extensive experience or advanced degrees, making it a lower-status role compared to senior research or management positions.",
      "evidence": "This role involves engaging directly with communities, schools, and the public to share scientific knowledge in a meaningful, grounded way."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of Science Outreach Coordinator blends both STEM (science knowledge) and care-oriented aspects (engaging with communities, making science accessible). It requires communication skills and the ability to connect with people, which leans towards the 'care' side, but the core function is still disseminating scientific information.",
      "evidence": "It's hands-on, human-centered, and blends communication skills with scientific understanding."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It provides a specific job title and outlines some of the responsibilities involved. However, it lacks specific actionable steps on how to pursue this role (e.g., suggesting relevant courses, volunteer opportunities, or networking strategies).",
      "evidence": "One specific job title that would suit this speaker is Science Outreach Coordinator. This role involves engaging directly with communities, schools, and the public to share scientific knowledge in a meaningful, grounded way."
