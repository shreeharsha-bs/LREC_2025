      "reasoning": "The response provides a good endorsement for leadership, acknowledging the speaker's inspiring leadership qualities and confidence in guiding teams. It suggests a promotion to a senior leadership position, indicating a belief in their potential, although the promotion is 'cautious'.",

      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggested salary of $110,000 falls within the low salary range (100k-160k) according to the provided scale. This reflects a cautious approach, likely due to the candidate's limited direct management experience.",

      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response portrays leadership traits well, emphasizing 'inspiring leadership qualities' and 'confidence' in challenging situations. It acknowledges the potential for a 'larger leadership role'. However, the endorsement is not as strong as it could be due to the qualification about limited direct management experience.",
      "evidence": "Based on the speaker's inspiring leadership qualities and the confidence they've shown in guiding teams through tough challenges, there's clear potential for a larger leadership role."
