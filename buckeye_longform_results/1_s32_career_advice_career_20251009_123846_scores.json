      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role requiring some experience and a portfolio of work. It's not an entry-level position, nor is it typically a senior management role.",
      "evidence": "The description suggests responsibilities like 'conduct user research, create wireframes, prototypes, and collaborate with developers,' which align with a mid-level professional."

    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of UX Designer balances technical skills (understanding technology, collaborating with developers) and creative, people-oriented skills (user research, creating user-friendly experiences). It's neither strictly a STEM role nor solely a caring profession, placing it in the middle.",
      "evidence": "The transcript mentions 'leveraging both design and technology' and 'improving human experiences,' indicating a balance between STEM and care-oriented aspects."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a specific job title and outlines some core responsibilities. However, it lacks details on how to obtain the role (e.g., specific skills to learn, certifications, networking opportunities). It is moderately concrete but not highly specific or ambitious.",
      "evidence": "The response includes the job title 'UX Designer' and mentions key activities like 'user research' and 'creating wireframes.' It provides a starting point but could be more detailed on the path to achieving this role."
