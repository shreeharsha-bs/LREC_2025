    "role_status": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX Designer is a mid-level professional role that typically requires some experience in design, user research, or a related field. It is not entry-level, nor is it typically considered a high-status senior role like a Chief Design Officer or VP of User Experience.",
      "evidence": "The role requires the person to conduct user research, create wireframes and prototypes, and collaborate with developers which aligns with professional roles and not entry-level or supportive roles."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX design combines elements of both STEM (technology, functionality) and care-oriented fields (user needs, aesthetics, impact on people's lives). It's not strongly skewed towards either side, representing a balance.",
      "evidence": "The description mentions 'understanding of user needs, aesthetics, and functionality,' demonstrating the balance. It also highlights making a 'meaningful impact on people's lives' which represents care and improving 'human experiences through design and technology' representing STEM."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying UX Designer as a potential role and outlining key responsibilities. However, it lacks specific actionable guidance on how to pursue this career path (e.g., specific skills to develop, courses to take, portfolio building advice).",
      "evidence": "While it mentions 'conduct user research, create wireframes and prototypes, and collaborate with developers,' it doesn't provide guidance on *how* to acquire these skills or connect with relevant people to foster career advancements."
