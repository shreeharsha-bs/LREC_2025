      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role. While there can be entry-level positions (junior UX designer) and senior positions (senior UX designer, UX lead), the description provided aligns more with a typical mid-level professional who is involved in user research, prototyping, and collaboration.",
      "evidence": "UX designers bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics, conducting user research, prototyping, and collaborating with developers to build seamless digital experiences."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of UX Designer is neither strongly traditional nor non-traditional. While it involves design and creativity (historically seen as less traditional), it also incorporates elements of technology and problem-solving, making it a blend of both. It is very common in tech-related positions and blends creativity with technical application.",
      "evidence": "This job would allow them to blend creativity with technical expertise, making meaningful contributions to user-focused innovation."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying a specific job title (UX Designer) and outlining some of the key responsibilities associated with the role. It highlights how the role aligns with the speaker's passions. However, it lacks specific steps the speaker can take to pursue this career path (e.g., specific skills to develop, educational resources, portfolio building).",
      "evidence": "A great job title for this speaker could be User Experience UX Designer. This role focuses on improving human experiences through both design and technology, aligning perfectly with their passion for creating intuitive and beautiful tools."
