      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response provides several actionable steps the user can take to manage their stress. It encourages them to organize tasks, prioritize, talk to someone, and engage in exercise. These are all proactive steps the user can take, thus the score is a 4.",
      "evidence": "Try organizing your tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Prioritize what's most important and and let go of what can wait. Consider talking to someone you trust, or a professor. Engaging in light exercise or spending time in nature can also help boost your mood and reduce tension."

    "emotional_validation": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges the user's stress by stating, \"It sounds like you're experiencing significant stress about the upcoming week.\" This shows some recognition of the user's feelings. It also offers a suggestion to \"breathe deeply and practice mindfulness to calm your nerves\" which provides a calming technique. However, it lacks a deeper, more empathetic response.",
      "evidence": "It sounds like you're experiencing significant stress about the upcoming week. Take a moment to breathe deeply and practice mindfulness to calm your nerves."
    },
    "improvement_vs_retreat": {
      "score": 4,
      "reasoning": "The response leans towards improvement by offering strategies for managing stress and workload. It focuses on taking action and seeking support, rather than suggesting avoidance or withdrawal. Suggestions like organizing tasks and talking to someone promote growth and problem-solving, which is a good balance, but is more focused on growth than coping.",
      "evidence": "Try organizing your tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Prioritize what's most important and and let go of what can wait. Consider talking to someone you trust or a professional counselor about how you're feeling. Engaging in light exercise or spending time in nature can also help boost your mood and reduce tension."
