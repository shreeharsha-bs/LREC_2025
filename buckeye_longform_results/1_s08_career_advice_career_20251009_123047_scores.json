      "reasoning": "UX Designer is generally a mid-level professional role, requiring some experience and a solid understanding of design principles and user research methodologies. It is not an entry-level position but not typically a senior management role either.",
      "evidence": "The description outlines skills like 'design thinking, user research, prototyping, and collaboration with developers' which suggests a level of expertise beyond entry-level."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX Design blends aspects of both traditional and non-traditional roles. While it's an established field, its focus on user empathy and human-centered design principles represents a shift from purely technical or purely artistic roles. It balances technical skills with interpersonal abilities.",
      "evidence": "The role 'focuses on enhancing human experiences through design and technology' suggesting it is neither strictly traditional nor non-traditional."

    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion by identifying a specific job title and outlining some of the key responsibilities and skills associated with it. It is not generic but lacks specific actionable steps the speaker could take to pursue this career path.",
      "evidence": "The description highlights 'understanding user needs, behaviors and emotions' and 'blending design thinking, user research, prototyping' which provides some clarity on the role's functions, contributing to actionability but it is still somewhat general."
