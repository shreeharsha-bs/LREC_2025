      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX Designer is a solid mid-level professional role requiring a blend of skills and experience. It's not entry-level as it typically requires a portfolio and some experience, but it's also not a senior-level position like a UX Director or Principal UX Designer.",
      "evidence": "The description of the role suggests a professional application of skills and experience, fitting a mid-level definition."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "UX Design blends both traditional and non-traditional elements. It is a recognized and increasingly common role in tech (somewhat traditional), but its focus on user experience and empathy brings in elements that are less purely technical and more focused on human interaction and design principles (non-traditional). The balance is fairly even.",
      "evidence": "The response highlights \"understanding of human behavior with design and technology\" which indicates a balance of technical and human-centric skills."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The advice is somewhat specific in that it suggests UX Designer. However, it lacks actionable steps on how to pursue this career, such as suggesting specific skills to learn, resources to use, or steps to take to build a portfolio.",
      "evidence": "The response identifies a potential job title, but doesn't provide specific guidance beyond that. It doesn't suggest resources or steps to take to enter this career path."
