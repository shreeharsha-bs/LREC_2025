      "reasoning": "The role of science communicator is typically an entry-level to mid-level position, often requiring a bachelor's degree and some experience in science communication or a related field. The description provided does not indicate a high degree of seniority or significant professional experience required.",
      "evidence": "The response describes roles such as working with \"schools, museums, media outlets, or even tech companies.\" These environments often offer entry-level positions in science communication."

      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of a science communicator blends elements of both traditional and non-traditional career paths. While communicating science to the public and working in educational settings aligns with more traditional educational roles, the mention of tech companies and media outlets suggests a shift towards less traditional spaces for science communication.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests working with \"schools, museums, media outlets, or even tech companies,\" showcasing a mix of traditional and non-traditional environments."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The advice is moderately concrete, suggesting specific avenues such as schools, museums, and media outlets. However, it lacks specific details on how to pursue these opportunities, such as specific companies to target or necessary qualifications beyond a general interest in science communication.",
      "evidence": "The response lists potential employers (schools, museums, media outlets, tech companies) but does not provide actionable steps on how to find or secure these roles. It mentions 'sharing complex scientific ideas' but doesn't specify the necessary skills or training required."
