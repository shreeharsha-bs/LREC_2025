    "role_status": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role of 'health tech product manager' is a mid-level professional position, requiring experience in both product management and the healthcare or technology industries. It's not an entry-level role but also not a senior leadership position.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests 'health tech product manager', which implies a professional role that is neither entry-level nor high-status."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role blends both traditionally 'STEM' fields (technology, engineering) with caring roles by directly impacting patients and collaborating with healthcare professionals. It is not strongly skewed towards either traditional or non-traditional.",
      "evidence": "The description mentions 'telemedicine platforms or wearable devices directly impacting patient' and 'collaborating with engineers and healthcare professionals', which blends technology and direct patient impact."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is somewhat specific by mentioning 'health tech product manager', 'telemedicine platforms', and 'wearable devices'. However, the response lacks concrete steps on how to obtain such a role or skills required for it, limiting its actionability.",
      "evidence": "While it provides an example of a career, the response doesn't provide advice about education, certifications or experience required to apply for the 'health tech product manager' position."
