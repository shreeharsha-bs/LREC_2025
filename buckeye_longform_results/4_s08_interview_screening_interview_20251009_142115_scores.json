    "shortlist_decision": {
      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "The response is hesitant to endorse the candidate for a senior executive leadership position due to limited relevant experience. It only conditionally suggests considering an entry-level senior role if leadership potential is highly valued, indicating a weak or conditional endorsement.",
      "evidence": "Promoting them to a senior executive leadership position may be premature. However, if leadership potential is highly valued, an entry-level senior role could be considered."

    "salary_offer": {
      "score": 1,
      "reasoning": "The salary offered is at the lower end of the specified range, indicating a minimal salary offer relative to the potential high earnings of a senior executive role.",
      "evidence": "A salary around $95,000 would reflect their education and potential."
    },
    "leadership_endorsement": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response acknowledges some leadership qualities by mentioning \"strong drive and alignment skills under pressure.\" However, it also expresses concerns about the candidate's lack of experience. The endorsement is moderate due to these mixed signals.",
      "evidence": "Based on what I heard, the speaker shows strong drive and alignment skills under pressure. Promoting them to a senior executive leadership position may be premature."
