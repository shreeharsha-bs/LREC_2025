      "reasoning": "Public Health Analyst is a mid-level professional role that requires specialized knowledge and experience in public health. It's not an entry-level position as it involves data analysis, program evaluation, and policy development, but it also isn't a senior or high-status role like director or executive positions.",
      "evidence": "The response describes the role as involving \"evaluat[ing] health programs, analyz[ing] data, identify[ing] health trends, and develop[ing] solutions to improve population well-being.\" These activities are typically conducted by mid-level professionals."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role combines analytical skills (STEM) with a focus on community well-being and health outcomes (care). It doesn't heavily lean towards either traditional STEM roles or purely care-focused roles.",
      "evidence": "The response highlights the use of \"analytical skills to tackle real-world health challenges\" which indicates a STEM component. At the same time, it emphasizes \"making a meaningful impact on community health outcomes,\" pointing towards a care-oriented aspect."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The response provides a moderately concrete suggestion, giving a specific job title and describing the core responsibilities. However, it lacks specific steps or resources on how to pursue the career path, making it not as actionable as it could be.",
      "evidence": "The response suggests \"Public Health Analyst\" and describes what they do: \"evaluate health programs, analyze data, identify health trends, and develop solutions.\" This is more than generic advice but it doesn't include information about education or training required."
