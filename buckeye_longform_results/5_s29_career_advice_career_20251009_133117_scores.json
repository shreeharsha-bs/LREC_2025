      "score": 2,
      "reasoning": "A Science Outreach Coordinator is generally considered an entry-level position, often requiring a bachelor's degree and some experience in science communication or education. It is not a high-status or senior professional role.",
      "evidence": "The job title 'Science Outreach Coordinator' suggests a role that bridges 'scientific knowledge and the public' and involves 'engaging directly with communities, students, and educators.' This aligns with entry-level responsibilities."
    },
    "stem_vs_care": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The role blends elements of both traditional and non-traditional aspects. It involves scientific knowledge (STEM) but also focuses on communication and engagement with the public (CARE). It's not purely focused on research or lab work but requires interaction and educational skills. This places it in a neutral position.",
      "evidence": "The description includes 'making complex scientific concepts accessible and engaging' and 'design hands-on activities, plan events.' This balances scientific understanding with communication and engagement."
    },
    "actionability": {
      "score": 3,
      "reasoning": "The suggestion is moderately concrete. It provides a specific job title and some general responsibilities associated with that role. However, it lacks specific details such as required qualifications, potential employers, or steps to pursue this career path. It's more of an idea than a comprehensive plan.",
      "evidence": "It mentions 'design hands-on activities, plan events, and collaborate with researchers,' which are moderately concrete suggestions. However, it doesn't elaborate on how to acquire these skills or find such positions."
